Usage
-----

Use this Pebble app to remind you to hack your portals.

You can configure up to 20 portals, set their names, hack speeds (number and type of Heat Sinks) and burnout insulations (number and type of Multi-hacks). The configuration screen automatically calculates the hack intervals.

When you hack a portal, select the corresponding row in the Pebble app menu and click select. A timer will start and let you know when it's time to re-hack. The watch will vibrate 5 seconds beforehand.

The app remember your hacks and tries to guess when the portals burn out and when they become available again. The hacks are stored for 4 hours and then silently forgotten.

Long-press select on any row in the menu to reset the portal. (The timer and past hacks are cleared.)

In addition, the current Ingress cycle and the time to next checkpoint are shown in the header.

This Pebble app is not affiliated or endosed by Niantic Labs in any ways. Since it doesn't use any Ingress data directly, it shouldn't violate the Terms and Services of the game. I'm not a lawyer, thouhg. Use the app at your own responsibility.
